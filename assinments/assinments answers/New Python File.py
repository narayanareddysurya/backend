# Program to read two numbers from the keyboard and print their sum

# Read the first number from the keyboard
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Read the second number from the keyboard
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Print the result
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", sum_result)
